Overall, 16% of children in our pooled sample had not received a dose of DPT-containing vaccine. There was a 0.8% point decline in zero-dose prevalence per year on average across the period studied. A single percentage point average annual decline in zero-dose prevalence was associated with an average annual decrease of 1.4 deaths in the postneonatal and childhood period per 1000 live births. Gavi-eligible countries had a much faster decline in zero-dose prevalence than other countries.

Less is known, however, about whether the observed relationship persists after accounting for all household-level factors which may confound the association between anemia and schooling.METHODS: Nationally representative data on adolescents aged 15-18 years with data on measured hemoglobin level and school attendance were extracted from India's National Family Health Surveys conducted between 2005 and 2021. We compared school attendance between adolescents living in the same household but with varying levels of hemoglobin concentration, while controlling for age and period effects. We assessed heterogeneity in the relationship between anemia and school attendance across anemia severity groups and socio-demographic characteristics.RESULTS: The proportion of adolescents with any anemia is 55.2% (95% CI: 55.0-55.5) among young women and 31.0% (95% CI: 30.6-31.5) among young men. In conventional (between-household) regression models, having any anemia is associated with a 2.5 percentage point reduction (95% CI: 2.1-2.8) in school attendance; however, in household fixed-effects models, anemia has qualitatively small and non-significant effects on school attendance. Our results are consistent using alternative model specifications as well as across anemia severity groups, genders, types of relationship to the household head, household wealth quintiles, and states and union territories in India.CONCLUSIONS: This within-household analysis finds little evidence that anemia is associated with school attendance among adolescents in India.

Understanding the prevalence of zero-food children (defined for research purposes as children aged 6 to 23 months who did not consume animal milk, formula, or solid or semisolid food during the last 24 hours) is essential for targeted interventions to improve feeding practices.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the percentage of zero-food children in 92 low- and middle-income countries.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study analyzed nationally representative cross-sectional household data of children aged 6 to 23 months from the Demographic and Health Surveys and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys conducted between May 20, 2010, and January 27, 2022. Data were obtained from 92 low- and middle-income countries. Standardized procedures were followed to ensure data comparability and reliability. Both percentage and number of zero-food children were estimated.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcome studied was defined as a binary variable indicating children aged 6 to 23 months who had not been fed any animal milk, formula, or solid or semisolid foods during the 24 hours before each survey, as reported by the mother or caretaker.RESULTS: A sample of 276 379 children aged 6 to 23 months (mean age, 14.2 months [95% CI, 14.15-14.26 months]) in 92 low- and middle-income countries was obtained, of whom 51.4% (95% CI, 51.1%-51.8%) were boys. The estimated percentage of zero-food children was 10.4% (95% CI, 10.1%-10.7%) in the pooled sample, ranging from 0.1% (95% CI, 0%-0.6%) in Costa Rica to 21.8% (95% CI, 19.3%-24.4%) in Guinea. The prevalence of zero-food children was particularly high in West and Central Africa, where the overall prevalence was 10.5% (95% CI, 10.1%-11.0%), and in India, where the prevalence was 19.3% (95% CI, 18.9%-19.8%). India accounted for almost half of zero-food children in this study.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of 276 379 children aged 6 to 23 months, substantial disparities in the estimates of food consumption across 92 low- and middle-income countries were found.

This paper estimated the relationship between stunting prevalence and age for children 0-59 months old in 94 low- and middle-income countries. The overall stunting prevalence was 32%. We found higher stunting prevalence among older children until around 28 months of age-presumably from longer exposure times and accumulation of adverse exposures to undernutrition and infections. In most countries, the stunting prevalence was lower for older children after around 28 months-presumably mostly due to further adverse exposures being less detrimental for older children, and catch-up growth. The age for which stunting prevalence was the highest was fairly consistent across countries. Stunting prevalence and gradient of the rise in stunting prevalence by age varied across world regions, countries, living standards and sex. Poorer countries and households had a higher prevalence at all ages and a sharper positive age gradient before age 2. Boys had higher stunting prevalence but had peak stunting prevalence at lower ages than girls. Stunting prevalence was similar for boys and girls after around age 45 months. These results suggest that programmes to prevent undernutrition and infections should focus on younger children to optimise impact in reducing stunting prevalence.

Prevalence of stunting was defined as percentage of children with height-for-age falling below -2 z-scores from the 2006 WHO growth standard.Findings: The average CPS across countries was 27.8% (95% CI: 27.5 to 28.1) and the average SPS was 23.3% (95% CI: 23.0 to 23.6). The rank of countries according to SPS differed substantially from the rank according to CPS. Guatemala, Bangladesh, and Nepal had the biggest improvement in ranking according to SPS compared to CPS, while Gambia, Mali, and Senegal had the biggest decline in ranking. Guatemala had the largest difference between CPS and SPS with a CPS of 45.2 (95% CI: 43.7 to 46.9) and SPS of 14.1 (95% CI: 12.6 to 15.8). Senegal had the largest increase in the prevalence after standardizing maternal height, with a CPS of 28.8% (95% CI: 25.8 to 30.2) and SPS of 31.6% (95% CI: 29.5 to 33.8). SPS correlates better than CPS with other population-level measures of child health.Conclusions: Our study suggests that CPS is sensitive to adjustment for maternal height. Maternal height, while a strong predictor of child stunting, is not amenable to policy interventions.

This paper estimated the nonlinear effects of postneonatal mortality rate—a proxy for adversity, particularly infections and undernutrition—in a 50 km radius, occurring over the period of infancy, on the subsequent height-for-age and school attendance of the surviving children. The results indicated that an adverse environment in infancy negatively affected height-for-age at age 1–4 years: At relatively low levels of adversity (at the 10th percentile of postneonatal mortality rate), an additional postneonatal death per 100 person-years decreased height-for-age of the survivors by almost 2% of the mean deficit in height (relative to a common growth standard) when comparing siblings born into different levels of adversity. At high levels of adversity, no effect was found for height-for-age while a small positive association was observed for school attendance at age 7–16 years.

To provide information for policymakers to plan for multi-layer health strategies targeting child health, it is essential to quantify the distribution of under-5 deaths by age groups.METHODS: Using 245 Demographic and Health Surveys from 64 low- and middle-income countries conducted between 1986 and 2018, we compiled a database of 2,437,718 children under-5 years old with 173,493 deaths. We examined the share of deaths that occurred in the neonatal (< 1 month), postneonatal (1 month to 1 year old), and childhood (1 to 5 years old) periods to the total number of under-5 deaths at both aggregate- and country-level. We estimated the annual change in share of deaths to track the changes over time. We also assessed the association between share of deaths and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.RESULTS: Neonatal deaths accounted for 53.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 52.7, 53.4) of the total under-5 deaths. The neonatal share of deaths was lower in low-income countries at 44.0% (43.5, 44.5), and higher in lower-middle-income and upper-middle income countries at 57.2% (56.8, 57.6) and 54.7% (53.8, 55.5) respectively.

Adult height, in particular shorter height, has been suggested to contribute to the pathophysiology and epidemiology of diabetes and may inform how adverse environmental conditions in early life affect diabetes risk. We therefore systematically analyzed the association of adult height and diabetes across LMICs, where such conditions are prominent.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We pooled individual-level data from nationally representative surveys in LMICs that included anthropometric measurements and diabetes biomarkers. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for the relationship between attained adult height and diabetes using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models. We estimated ORs for the pooled sample, major world regions, and individual countries, in addition to stratifying all analyses by sex. We examined heterogeneity by individual-level characteristics.RESULTS: Our sample included 554,122 individuals across 25 population-based surveys. Average height was 161.7 cm (95% CI 161.2-162.3), and the crude prevalence of diabetes was 7.5% (95% CI 6.9-8.2).

In this article, we develop a geomapping approach to identify high-risk areas by considering four nonclinical risk correlates for COVID-19. These are population density, percentage of the population that is exposed to crowding in a household, percentage of the population without access to handwashing facilities, and percentage of the population over 65 years of age. We provide an empirical proof-of-concept demonstration for this approach for India at two critical geographic units: districts and parliamentary constituencies, collectively responsible for policy administration and governance. Our findings suggest that the geographies of the four nonclinical risk correlates are largely independent of one another (i.e., at most, there is a small correlation between measures). We avoid applying differential weights to the four measures or combining these measures into a single index, as there is an intrinsic rationale for viewing them separately since they represent mostly independent dimensions of risks that require different responses. Our primary objective was to leverage currently available data to provide decision makers detailed information and geovisualization, identifying areas with potentially differential susceptibilities to COVID-19. The information provided here can be used as a means for further ground verification and, when appropriate, for impact planning and intervention, as well as providing a rationale for eventual efficacy assessment of different nonpharmaceutical interventions.

Conversely, Muslims and Christians coexisting within religiously heterogeneous communities showed no differences in child health.",  keywords  = "West Africa, Religion, Child Health, Mortality, Height-for-age",  author    = "Omar Karlsson",  year      = "2019",  doi       = "10.1111/padr.12296",  language  = "English",  volume    = "45",  pages     = "707--738",  journal   = "Population and Development Review",  issn      = "0098-7921",  publisher = "Wiley-Blackwell",  number    = "4", }

Under-5 mortality is also known to be patterned by socioeconomic factors. This study examines sex differentials and sex-specific wealth gradients in neonatal, postneonatal and child mortality in India. Methods: Repeated cross-sectional study of nationally representative samples of 298 955 children 0-60 months old from the National Family Health Surveys conducted in 2005-2006 and 2015-2016. The study used logistic regression models as well as Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Overall, boys had greater neonatal mortality than girls and the difference increased between 2005-2006 and 2015-2016. Girls had greater postneonatal and child mortality, but the difference decreased between the surveys and was not statistically significant for child mortality in 2015-2016. A negative wealth gradient was found for all mortality outcomes. Neonatal mortality was persistently greater for boys. Girls had higher child mortality than boys at low levels of wealth and greater postneonatal mortality over much of the wealth distribution. The wealth gradient in neonatal mortality increased between surveys. Females had a stronger wealth gradient than boys for child mortality. Conclusion: Not distinguishing between neonatal, postneonatal and child mortality masks important gender-specific and wealth-specific disparities in under-5 mortality in India. Substantial gains towards the Sustainable Development Goals can be made by combating neonatal mortality, especially at low levels of wealth. Although impressive improvements have been made in reducing the female disadvantage in postneonatal and child mortality, concerted engagements are necessary to eliminate the gender gap - especially in poor households and in north India.",  keywords  = "gender, inequalities, mortality",  author    = "Omar Karlsson and Rockli Kim and William Joe and Subramanian, {S.

We investigated how three measures of living arrangements of older adults have changed with ART coverage: the number of older individuals living without working-age adults, the number of older individuals living with only dependent children (i.e. 'missing generation' households), and the number of working-age adults per household where an older individual lives.RESULTS: Our sample consisted of 297 331 older adults. An increase in ART coverage of 1% was associated with a 0.7 percentage point reduction (P < 0.001) in the probability of an older adult living without working-age adult and a 0.2 percentage point reduction (P = 0.005) in the probability of an older adult living in a 'missing generation' household. Increases in ART coverage were also associated with more working-age adults in households with at least one older adult. In our study countries, representing 75% (749 million) of the sub-Saharan population, an additional 103 000-358 000 older adults could be living with working-age adults as a result of increased ART coverage (1%).CONCLUSION: The scale-up of ART has likely led to substantial increases in co-residence between older and working-age adults in Africa. Returns to investments in HIV treatment will be too low, if the social benefits from these changes in living arrangements of older adults are not taken into account.",  author    = "{De Neve}, Jan-Walter and Omar Karlsson and Lelani Coetzee and Henning Schr{\"o}der and Subramanian, {S V} and Till B{\"a}rnighausen and Sebastian Vollmer",  year      = "2018",  month     = sep,  day       = "10",  doi       = "10.1097/QAD.0000000000001917",  language  = "English",  volume    = "32",  pages     = "2051--2057",  journal   = "AIDS",  issn      = "1473-5571",  publisher = "Lippincott Williams & Wilkins",  number    = "14", }

Both education and child health have improved, however, as well as related factors. These changes may have implications for the observed association.MethodsWe used Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 43 countries at two points in time, between 1991 and 2016, to test if the association of parental education with child health has changed over time. We explored how changes relate to commonly cited confounders and pathways, including fertility, household living standards, health care use, urbanicity and geographical clustering. We used linear probability models, Gelbach decomposition, and assessed a range of sensitivity specifications.ResultsThe point estimate for an additional year of maternal education has attenuated by 0.27% points (56%) for under-5 mortality, 0.34% points (15%) for child stunting, 0.42% points (30%) for child underweight and 0.09% points (24%) for child wasting. The point estimate for paternal education has attenuated by 0.20% points (53%) for under-5 mortality, 0.15% points (8%) for child stunting, 0.28% points (24%) for underweight and 0.06% points (19%) for wasting. Changes in confounding and mediation by fertility, household living standards and urban-rural differences explain to a large extent the attenuations. Geospatial clustering increasingly drives the association of parental education with child health.ConclusionsThe role of parental education in child health has attenuated considerably over time in low-resource settings. Decision makers should take into account this weakening association when designing policies aimed at improving child health.",  keywords  = "Low- and middle-income countries, parental education, under-5 mortality, stunting, wasting, underweight, Gelbach decomposition",  author    = "Omar Karlsson and {De Neve}, Jan-Walter and SV Subramanian",  year      = "2018",  month     = aug,  day       = "7",  doi       = "10.1093/ije/dyy158",  language  = "English",  volume    = "48",  pages     = "83--97",  journal   = "International Journal of Epidemiology",  issn      = "0300-5771",  publisher = "Oxford University Press",  number    = "1", }
